# Mobile HRI Design
The main repository for the Mobile Human Robot Interaction Design class given by Wendy Ju in the Spring term of 2023 at Cornell & Cornell Tech.

# Course Canvas Page
The course syllabus is online at https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/51500

# Class Discussion
Since our course spans both Master's and PhD students who are both in Ithaca and NYC, we will attempt to use Canvas as the course discussion forum. 

# Student Repositories
Fork the Mobile HRI Lab Page repository; detailed instructions for creating your lab hub and updating your labs are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2022Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).

When submitting your assignments, you will update your assignments on your class lab hub, and post a link to your Github lab page on Canvas. Graders will review the assignments sometime after the due date. Late assignments (e.g. your assignment is missing/incomplete at our grading time, which is after the due date) will be penalized by one letter grade per day late.

# Office Hours
The main time to talk to the teaching team face to face about your labs or projects are during the Thursday labs.

Outside of that time, the instructor and TA will be responsive to Canvas discussion, and usually respond within hours during their working day, and by the next working day otherwise.
